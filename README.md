# Mini eCommerce Frontend Project

This project is a frontend implementation of a mini eCommerce website built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, consuming the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com).  
It demonstrates a modern SPA (Single Page Application) with product listings, search, category filtering, wishlist, shopping cart, checkout, and caching for performance.
